# Contributing

A `Makefile` is provided for easy interaction with the project. To see
all available options run:

```
make help
```

## Running tests

To run all tests in the suite run:

```
make tests
```

### Integration tests

Some integration tests require collaborator permission on the `craft-store-test-charm`
charm package on the staging craft-store. These can be run by creating a pull request.

Other integration tests simply require a valid login to the staging charmhub store.
These can be run by exporting charmhub staging credentials to the environment
variable `CRAFT_STORE_CHARMCRAFT_CREDENTIALS`. An easy way to do this is to 
create a `charmcraft.yaml` file containing the lines:

    charmhub:
      api-url: "https://api.staging.charmhub.io"
      storage-url: "https://storage.staging.snapcraftcontent.com"

and then run `charmcraft login --export cc.cred` to login and
`export CRAFT_STORE_CHARMCRAFT_CREDENTIALS=$(cat cc.cred)` to put the credentials
into the environment variable. Note that if you do not have collaborator permissions
on `craft-store-test-charm`, some tests will fail rather than being skipped.

## Adding new requirements

If a new dependency is added to the project run:

```
make freeze-requirements
```

## Verifying documentation changes

To locally verify documentation changes run:

```
make docs
```

After running, newly generated documentation shall be available at
`./docs/_build/html/`.
